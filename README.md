# Language-Learning-L-Squared-Application

The main purpose of our project is to make the language learning process fun by using attractive visuals. We provide a way for people from different language backgrounds to learn other languages by translating them and connecting the words/sentences to their pictures. This facilitates Visual Learning which helps in better memorizing and understanding the language.
